# Capstone Project

This is a project for the Slightly Techie School Backend. I am in the Caramel Group

## Requirements
 - API Users must be able to create an account and log in.
 
 - All API calls must be authenticated
 
 - A user should be able to create, read, update and delete their calorie entry
 
 - A user should have a username, email, password, created_at fields
 
 - Each calorie entry has a date, time, text, and number of calories.
 
 - If the number of calories is not provided, the API should connect to a Calories API provider (for example, [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com)) and try to get the number of calories for the entered meal.
 
 - Implement foreign key constraints to enforce the relationship between users and calorie entry.
 
 - Use Postgres as the database
